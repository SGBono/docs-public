### BIOS/Firmware lock

If, when attempting to boot from an external USB drive or when attempting to modify BIOS settings, are prompted to enter an administrator password, follow these steps.

1. Turn off the system.

2. Turn on the system and start striking the **BIOS** key repeatedly. The most common BIOS keys are **F2**, **Del**, **Esc** and **F8**.

3. Keep striking the key even after seeing the manufacturer logo, until you see a menu with many options.

4. Click the "Unlock" button present at the bottom of the screen.

5. You should be greeted with this screen:

6. Go to https://bios-pw.org on another device

7. Enter the **System Number** found on the screen into the **Enter your code** field on the website and click **Get password**.

### No drivers listed under Snappy Driver Installer

For reasons unknown, there may be cases in which the driver installer does not list the drivers available for install correctly when launched for the first time, resulting in a blank window. If the driver installer launches looking like this or with nothing listed, follow these steps.

1. Close the driver installer window.

2. Click **No** when this dialog box shows up.

3. The driver installer window should launch again, hopefully with the drivers correctly listed this time.

4. If the driver installer window is still blank, please inform Chin Ray (head developer) or the server administrator present on-site. It would most likely be a server related issue in that case.



### "There was an error (doing something)... Try again?"

As the script gets continuously field-tested and patched, such errors are extremely uncommon, and would most likely point to server issues. However, there are a few steps to try first.

![Screenshot 2024-08-10 212231](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/103b95b2-eee6-4c94-9d9b-fcd507b14a57)

1. Click on the **Try Again** button.

2. If errors still persist, click the **Try Again** button one more time.

3. If the issues are still not resolved, inform Chin Ray (head developer) or the server administrator present on-site. With authorisation, you may try the **Offline Install** method:
   
   1. Click on the **Offline Install** button.
   
   2. You will see a prompt that asks you to **Insert a USB drive labelled "Drivers" and click OK**. Locate a USB drive that is marked **D** and insert it into the device.
   
   3. Click on the **OK** button.
   
   4. Complete the driver installation as per normal and then close the driver installer app.
   
   5. Wait for the installation to finish.
   
   6. Label the device **No apps** on a piece of masking tape and place it in the **Needs repairs** pile.



### Program stuck for a long time

There may also be some specific rare cases where the program is stuck doing the same thing for an unusually long period of time (around 15-20 min). If you are experiencing this, follow these steps.

1. On **version 4.0.2** of the script, you are now able to close and restart the script much more easily by clicking the X button.

2. In the confirmation dialog, click on the **Yes** button.

3. You will then be asked if you want to restart the app. Click on **Yes**.

4. Restart the installation process again as per normal.
