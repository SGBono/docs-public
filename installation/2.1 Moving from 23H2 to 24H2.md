# What to expect in the move from 23H2 to 24H2

In Microsoft's latest Windows 11 24H2 update, several key changes have been made, including several major changes to the Windows Setup UI. In this document, we will go through:
1. What to expect from the new and notable changes to Windows and Windows Setup UI, and
2. Any other notable changes that were made to the Windows images deployed in SGBono as part of this update.

## Notable UI Changes in Windows

As part of this update, Microsoft revamped the Windows Setup UI. These are the changes made in Windows Setup from 23H2 to 24H2:

This is a HORRIBLE update, and I hope that the Microsoft employee(s) who came up with and implemented this update gets fired. You are a terrible, terrible person. Could've at least thrown a GPO at us to revert it, but no.

## Changes to the Windows images
- Made changes to the way the unattended install script is handled such that it will be easier to skip unattended install.
  - If unattended install needs to be disabled for whatever reason, follow these steps:
    1. Plug the USB into a device with Windows already installed
    2. Open File Explorer and open the disk labelled **Ventoy**.
    3. Navigate to the **ventoy** folder.
    4. Rename the file **ventoy.json** to **ventoy.json.BAK** or other suitable name.
   
- Windows Recall is **ENABLED** by default (but will still not work on non-Copilot+ devices). This is because disabling or removing the feature beforehand breaks Windows Explorer. I may add a post-installation task that disables or removes this if necessary.
- Windows Copilot PWA remains **INSTALLED**. This is because I can't figure out how to uninstall it beforehand. I may add a post-installation task that removes this if necessary.
- 24H2 introduced a new HVCI based feature to protect LSASS from attacks such as memory dump attacks or mimikatz attacks, protecting Windows user passwords. This feature will remain **ENABLED** in our images.

Below: Attempting to create a memory dump of LSASS now fails where it worked in 23H2 and before.

Memory integrity and other HVCI based features remain **DISABLED** by default.

- We continue to resist the automatic Device Encryption feature in our images. It remains **DISABLED**.
  - This feature basically BitLocker encrypts your entire Windows device automatically when signed in with a Microsoft account.
  - This feature will make hardware repair or Windows recovery operations A LOT more difficult, as we will need to guide the customer to sign into their Microsoft account online to retrieve the BitLocker Recovery Key. Might not sound like a problem, until you realise that they forgot which email and password they used.
  - TPM based BitLocker encryption (which is pretty much what is used everywhere nowadays) makes it such that we are unable to retrieve the BitLocker hash due to the TPM's protection, making brute forcing the key unfeasible.
 
- Windows Spotlight in the desktop has been enabled by default by Microsoft in this update, and I decided to leave it **ENABLED**. You will now see a beautiful image of nature instead of the default Windows 11 wallpaper when you first log into Windows.
